          Movement is a chain of climbing gyms throughout the United States with programs for everyone from a beginner to a several year veteran.
          Movement Gyms is notable laregly due to its size and availability across the nation, as Movement has managed to open and maintain several
          locations not just is a specific region or on one coast like other gyms, but has locations across the entire United States. Movement has some
          notable gyms under its belt and has been running for several years even before the recent boom. Movement has a wide range of programs, even
          going beyond climbing into yoga and other standard workout and wellness programs, but they definitely have a focus in climbing.

          Movement has locations in: California, Oregon, Colorado, Illinois, Texas, Maryland, and Virginia, with plans to expand in the future. The
          reason why this whole section has just revolved around where Movement is located is because it really is the most notable thing about their gyms.
          Beyond their reach, they are pretty standard climbing gyms with not really any special aspects associated with them, they're just solid gyms that
          have a good climbing focus that happens to be funded by an outside company, thus allowing them to expand more than any other brand.
