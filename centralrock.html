                Central Rock Gym is a climbing gym brand out of the New England area; specifically with locations in New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, 
                and Florida (you know, part of New England). Central Rock Gym is generally regarded as a very solid option for learning to rock climb with great facilities
                that has been very well trusted for years. They have a wide range of programs with very solid instructors for new climbers as well as veteran climbs as of 
                very high difficulty (the highest that I saw was a climb of grade v8c, nicknamed The Steep Wall).

                Central Rock Gym also has one of the largest rock walls in the country, with a rock wall of 28,000 square feet of climbable area, creating a very unique
                experience when compared to other climbing gyms. It also allows for them to have a wide variety of different climbs of different difficulties, with flat, 
                inclined, steep, and every classification in-between being present at many levels. It creates a climbing environment that creates many different opportunities
                to experience different climbs and at a scale that most other gyms can't rival.
