                Brooklyn Boulders is a climbing gym brand with a very wide reach and a name that is very well known amongst people that go to
                climbing gyms. Brookyln Boulders has been notable in the past for it's very creative asthetic in it's gyms, specifically its use
                of graffiti in its wall designs to give them a unique look that fits in with the area and culture that they operate in. Brooklyn
                Boulders, as the name would imply, has a location in Queensbridge, New York, and then also West Loop in Chicago, Illinois. You know, 
                neither in Brooklyn. Of the gyms covered on this site, Brooklyn Boulders is the smallest in terms of location number, but strangely 
                seems to be one of the more well known names in the business because of their unique appearance and the significance of the areas 
                they're situated in. Brooklyn Boulders had a record holding 40,000 square foot climbing wall at one of its locations that was well received, 
                though that location was recently sold off to one of its competitors. Ok, Brooklyn Boulders was a notable brand in the rock climbing world 
                a few years ago. However, recently the brand has started to have to sell some of its locations to others to maintain some core locations, 
                which has led them to go from about 5 locations at the start of this year to 2 now. They're a struggling gym brand that falls back on to
                its unique culture and style because other brands have started to catch up on what made it unique and outperform it.
