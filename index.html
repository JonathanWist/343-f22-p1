      Rock climbing is a very physically demanding, strenuous activity that can be a lot of fun and give a great workout. However, it can be difficult to find climbing gyms in 
      your area, as there aren't many of them around because of how large the facilities are, how difficult they are to maintain, and how niche the activity of climbing is. The
      image on the left can give an idea as to just how large some of these spaces are, as this is quite a small section of a small gym and it already takes up a substantial
      amount of room. However, there are still quite a number of high-profile gyms out there that provide services in larger areas, and so I aim to point out some of the more 
      popular ones that have good programs for people new to climbing and for several year veterans to the activity.

      There are two major different types of rock climbing styles: bouldering and standard rock-climbing. Standard climbing is what you would normally think of when you think of
      rock-climbing, vertical walls with different types of holds and a support rope to help guide you back to the ground. Bouldering adds in the jutts from walls, the horizontal
      reach-around work that you see in the left wall in the image on the right. Bouldering also generally doesn't use the same supports, but also doesn't go as high as standard
      climbing does. Both types of rock-climbing are on the rise, but you may see more stuff online about bouldering styles of climbing due to them increasing in popularity over
      the past several years, however both styles are still very much gaining in popularity.

        For new climbers, this information is important. On the left (or above on mobile), you see a scale of different letters and numbers. This is the scale of difficulty for
        different climbs, with two different scales that could be used but generally the French scale is what you'll see at climbing gyms and such (you would most likely see the
        Yosemite Decimal System at a free climb). The French system ascends from 1 to 9 with some climbs actually being graded above at 10 or even 11, but those are rare. The climb
        gets more difficulty with increase in number and in some cases, the different letters showcase increases in difficulty, so a v8c is harder than a v8a.
