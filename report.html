  <h2><a href="design/CS 343 Website Design Sketch.pdf">Link to design sketch</a></h2>
  <p>
    The above design sketch hits every point layed out in the description. The sketch includes usage of the stylistic choices
    of each page and and labels to detail what is what on each page. The design also showcases the general layout of each page,
    though some changed a bit after making the design document.

  <h2>Technical Components</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      There are 5 pages on the site (home, movement, centralrock, brooklyn, and info) with home being on index.html. report.html is
      present in the folder, but is not on the site.
